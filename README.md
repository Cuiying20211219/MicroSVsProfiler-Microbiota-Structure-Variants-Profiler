# MicroSVsProfiler-Microbiota-Structure-Variants-Profiler
Based on previous software and advanced analysis process of microbial SV, we synthesized and implemented a pipeline called MicroSVsProfiler (Microbiota Structure Variants Profiler), which can perform preprocessing of metagenomic data, detect structural variations.
